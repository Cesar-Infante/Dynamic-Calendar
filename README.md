# Dynamic-Calendar

For this challenge we had to build out a work day scheduler! Using moment.js api was really interesting and seeing how different parts can be changed depending on the time. One of the features implemented was adding if the time-block was in the past present or future and cordinating it with a color! one of the challenging issues I ran into was implementing localStorage, spending a hefty amount of time researching and testing which got the best of me now but hey its a challenge for a reason! Having this issue only opened my eyes to that theres more to learn and to keep improving.
